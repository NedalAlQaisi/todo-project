- What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
From my impressions so far... I hate wireframe work because sometimes it doesn't match the actual work.

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
I was expecting it to take me half an hour, but it took me two hours because of the wireframe.
